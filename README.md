=======

A confused variety of random things, from blocks to items to entities. The point is there is no point.

Modpacks
========
Farrago is free to use in modpacks, but please don't build it yourself. Use the [release](https://github.com/AesenV/Farrago/releases) versions.  
If you add Farrago to your modpack, please add it's name, and a link to it if it's public, to the [wiki](https://github.com/AesenV/Farrago/wiki) ([edit link](https://github.com/AesenV/Farrago/wiki/Home/_edit)).  
**You do not need to ask to add Farrago to a modpack.** Just try to do what's put above. They're both optional, but I'd appreciate if you follow them.

Compiling
=========
`./gradlew build`. Your file is at ./build/libs/Farrago-&lt;version&gt;.jar

Farrago
=======

A confused variety of random things, from blocks to items to entities. The point is there is no point.


I know it's kind of a mess; this used to be just one mod that added the Kahur and I thought it'd be a good idea to refactor it into a sub-mod (iota) instead of adding new stuff to the existing mod.

I may clean this up at some point in the future. Right now it's not a priority. It's a mod I make for fun.
